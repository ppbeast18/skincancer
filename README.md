## üí° About the Project

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, but early detection can save lives.  
This project leverages **deep learning** to automatically classify **dermatological images** as benign or malignant.  

Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning models** such as **EfficientNet**, this repository demonstrates a complete workflow ‚Äî from dataset preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

## üß¨ Dataset


Each image is labeled as one of several skin lesion types, e.g.:

- **Melanoma (malignant)**
- **Benign Keratosis**

The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model and Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Resizing all images to a fixed shape (e.g., 224√ó224)
   - Normalization to `[0,1]`
   - Data augmentation (flip, rotate, zoom)

2. **Model Training**
   - Base CNN built from scratch or using transfer learning models such as:
     - EfficientNetB0
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision / Recall / F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC
